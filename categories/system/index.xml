      <description>Abstraction is an interesting concept. For me personally, abstraction was never clearly explained. I left school and entered my first job knowing I should abstract things, but I realize now my understanding of abstraction amounted to obscurity.
Abstraction to me meant, “Don’t use that thing directly, abstract it and use some interface instead.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;That’s what good programmers do,&amp;rdquo; I told myself. I taught myself a lot about function pointers, and advanced OO techniques using pure virtual classes all to avoid using something directly.</description>

      <description>For the small programs we tend to implement as part of a semester project, or the simple &amp;ldquo;one-off/get-it-done&amp;rdquo; programs at work, system design rarely plays a part. However, even in the smallest problems a top-level system design is critical for consistency and ease of use. Class components, regardless of how precise and accurate they are in their own internal design, if they aren&amp;rsquo;t externally consistent with other objects, the system will be brittle, and difficult to use.</description>
