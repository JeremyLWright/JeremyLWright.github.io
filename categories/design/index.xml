      <description>The first time I opened Hillel&amp;rsquo;s book and skimmed the first chapter I was subconsciously looking for a reason not to sink a bunch of time into yet another language/ecosystem project. That bias prevented me from seeing the point of the first chapter.
Hillel&amp;rsquo;s first chapter ends with a definition of stuttering and how in the presence of real world temporal effects, a safe, reliable in all cases wire transfer system borders on impossible.</description>

      <description>For the small programs we tend to implement as part of a semester project, or the simple &amp;ldquo;one-off/get-it-done&amp;rdquo; programs at work, system design rarely plays a part. However, even in the smallest problems a top-level system design is critical for consistency and ease of use. Class components, regardless of how precise and accurate they are in their own internal design, if they aren&amp;rsquo;t externally consistent with other objects, the system will be brittle, and difficult to use.</description>
