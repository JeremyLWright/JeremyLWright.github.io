Parent takes some extreme views on how to use C++, but his examples for using the STL to simplify code are phenomenal. For a recent AI project I decided to apply Parent&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;no raw loops&rdquo;, I was blown away by the transformation&hellip; err std::transformation this had on my code. In this post I indented to demonstrate several complex code blocks, or overly specific code blocks what were replaced by some STL magic.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/productivity/">Productivity</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/c&#43;&#43;/">C&#43;&#43;</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/c&#43;&#43;11/">C&#43;&#43;11</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/stepanov/">Stepanov</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/stl/">STL</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/02/text-processing-for-programmers/">

That began my dabble in grep, awk and sed, and these tools will change your workflow and even how you think about profiling code.

            <p class="note title">The Turbulent History of Managed Code</p><p class="note date">Tuesday, August 28, 2012</p><p class="note content">Managed Code is a fascinating technology; Just-In-Time compilation provides advanced run-time optimization and strong type safety can render the hardware MMU obsolete. However the managed code renaissance is again in decline, and interestingly more than technology, business is changing the managed/native landscape. More than any other other metric, managed code is about maximizing programmer productivity.

However, even in the smallest problems a top-level system design is critical for consistency and ease of use. Class components, regardless of how precise and accurate they are in their own internal design, if they aren&rsquo;t externally consistent with other objects, the system will be brittle, and difficult to use.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/productivity/">Productivity</a><a class="category" href="/categories/system/">System</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/bottom-up/">bottom-up</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/top-down/">top-down</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2012/04/copyright-the-anti-innovator/">

Furthermore their derivative works, i.e. items creating using paintbrushes, are subject to copyright infringement. This of course is a fabrication, but this is exactly the point Oracle is trying to make when trying to copyright programming languages.

The first is built into how distributed version control functions, in that every clone is a branch itself. This is the branching method Joel Sposky recommends on hginit.com. The second method is called local branches. Initially I liked the local branch method; I liked it for the fact that I felt smart for using it. It did not improve productivity. There is a simple reason for this, with local branches it is difficult to diff the branch to the main branch of development e.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/productivity/">Productivity</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2011/10/making-c-like-python-the-anderson-smart-pointer-pattern/">

Dennis Ritchie once stated: The C Programming Language — A language which combines the flexibility of assembly language with the power of assembly language. C++ inherits much of that _flexibility, _however, this incidental complexity, can be relegated to a single class, leaving you with the high-level elegance of Python. RAII help with this additional complexity, however without a pattern for guidance implementing RAII consistently can be difficult, defeating the safety it provides.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/productivity/">Productivity</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/c&#43;&#43;/">C&#43;&#43;</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/d/">D</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/memory/">memory</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/python/">Python</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/raii/">RAII</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2011/08/hijacking-system-programs/">

I will use a tool fully knowing that its more than I need, just to learn something new. Initially, this is how I approached version control.
