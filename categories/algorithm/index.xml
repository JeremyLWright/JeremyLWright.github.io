      <title>Patterns are evidence of a language&#39;s lacking</title>

      <description>A coworker of mine stated something interesting, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;a pattern is evidence of missing feature in the language&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. At first I struggled with this statement. How can you design a language general enough to be widely used, and simultaneously cover all the desirable idioms such that patterns are built in? At first this seemed silly to me, until I heard Erik Meijer state in a Haskell lecture, &amp;ldquo;..this is why we implemented LINQ as a pattern instead of a language feature&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Type-Safe Variable Argument Lists</title>

      <description>Type-safety is a popular topic. Perceived as a panacea for bad software, the Department of Defense implemented Ada. The original thought was restriction synonymous with robustness. From this, opponents claim type safe languages place the programmer’s hands in handcuffs, thereby thwarting generic code. Modern languages, such as D, and Java leverage a statically checked type system with a focus on consistency, not restriction. Modern type systems abet generic code, without sacrificing robustness.</description>

      <title>Parallelism in D</title>

      <description>Parallelism, it sounds like a religion, and in some sense it is. Like many facets of software engineering, writing good parallel code is more of an art than a science. I come from a FPGA background where parallelism is part of the language; part of the culture! The tools are designed to find deadlocks, analyze timing and the language itself is fully aware of parallelism. The hardware world understands parallelism, yet writing parallel software is still difficult.</description>

      <description>D Source Code
Sorting is a very important operation in computer programs. Knuth devotes an entire chapter to sorting and search. Sorting algorithms, like most algorithms, use the Big O notation to compare computational complexity. Bucket sort is one such sorting algorithm. however bucket sort typically doesn’t actually sort the array. In the normal case, bucket sort is used to partition the data set into groups, or buckets. Each bucket is then sorted using a separate algorithm such as quicksort, or insertion sort.</description>

      <title>D for the C&#43;&#43; Programmer</title>

      <description>As a comparative study, I am porting a Red-Black Tree from C++ to the D programming language (Part 1, Part 2). Overall D is an easy, practical transition for the C++ programmer. D provides a number of features for implementing correct code, however it is D’s simplicity that makes it truly enticing as a replacement. While D retains _C Style Syntax, _it is considerably simpler than C++, especially in the presence of exceptions.</description>

      <title>Class Invariants</title>

      <guid>/2011/05/class-invariants-red-black-tree-part-2/</guid>
      <description>This week, I started porting my C++ implementation of the Red-Black tree to D. I am trying to pay special attention to the features of D, intended to make writing correct code easier. While on that vane, I was reading an excellent article, discussing invariants, and I was pleased to find such a useful implementation of the class invariant in the D language.
Invariants come from the same “design-by-contract” idiom, famous for pre- and post- conditions.</description>

      <description>C++ Source Code D Source Code
D provides a number of features that simplify designing software, especially in the embedded environment. I will show in this 2 part comparison, between C++ and D, that D helps one write correct code. Correct code is something Andrei Alexandrescu, stresses heavily as a prominent feature of D. I use the Red-Black Tree for such a comparison since its complicated enough to make memory management difficult, while retaining real-world application.</description>

      <description>In homage to Jonathan Coulton, this summer I intend to explore a series of algorithms in an effort to both learn the D programming language, as well as deepen my computer science background. First up, the Red-Black Tree.</description>
