      <description>Hitting the compile and run button costs $1,000,000. How would such a cost affect your test strategy? As extreme as that sounds, its a harsh reality for ASIC designers. The start-up costs for an ASIC design are extreme, as a result ASIC verification is very important. Especially since you can&amp;rsquo;t just update a buggy ASIC. In software engineering, we design increasingly complex systems requiring more and more elegant test strategies. I propose ASIC verification is in a more mature state, and software engineers could learn a lot from the translation of these techniques.</description>

      <description>I really like all the little social media button on blogs. I hit the +1 and I feel like I contribute in some way. When I post here to my personal blog, wordpress automatically posts to my Facebook. Its entirely unoriginal, but I like it. However I think we need a -1 button for some articles. I read this: http://mashable.com/2011/06/22/arizona-social-media-day/ and thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dumb. I am embarrassed for my state.</description>
