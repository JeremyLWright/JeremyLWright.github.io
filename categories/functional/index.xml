      <description>A group of friends and I have been working on project euler for about a year now. I learned a great deal from this fantastic project, and it was the first time I was able to get a real handle on Haskell. Project Euler taught me make. It taught me better performance reporting techniques, honed my octave, and got me over that initial mind bending hump of Haskell. Thank you Project Euler, you will be missed.</description>

      <title>My Haskell Environment for Project Euler</title>

      <description>For the last several months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Project Euler in Haskell. My intent has been to learn Haskell, and grasp the functional concepts. While working on several problems it&amp;rsquo;s important to have a workflow that allows for a fast cycle time. I spent some time with Cabal, attempting to build a scheme that works efficiently, but was unable to do so. Instead I setup a mix of cabal-dev, and make to build a fast workflow that allow for compiling, testing, common code libraries, and benchmarks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve restarted my haskell programming education. Here is my implementation of FizzBuzz
fizzbuzz x | x `mod` 15 == 0 = &amp;quot;FIZZBUZZ&amp;quot; | x `mod` 3 == 0 = &amp;quot;FIZZ&amp;quot; | x `mod` 5 == 0 = &amp;quot;BUZZ&amp;quot; | otherwise = show x main = print (map fizzbuzz [1..100])  [suffusion-adsense client=&#39;ca-pub-6284398857369558&amp;rsquo; slot=&#39;1495369305&amp;rsquo; width=&#39;728&amp;rsquo; height=&#39;90&amp;rsquo;]</description>
