      <description>This semester, I&amp;rsquo;m taking an introduction to artificial intelligence, and despite this being the second week, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a great deal. Our second assignment was to implement a program in clingo (clasp on gringo) which is a derivative of Prologue. This is my first experience with a logical programming language, and I am intrigued to the possibilities.
Immediately I was intrigued by the freeform expressiveness of the language. The example we did in class for example was to determine which muppet went to which amusement park.</description>
