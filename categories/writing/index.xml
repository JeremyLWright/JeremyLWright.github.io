      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote my first article for codestrokes in February 2011 - right as I was
accepted to graduate school. My goal was to improve my writing in preparation
for writing a thesis. While through grad school I started with more
traditional writing tool. I started to learn to write, and I found my writing
style: Simplicity.  I started writing with a big fancy word processor.
I blogged with a massive database backed blogging engine. By the time
I finished my thesis, I was writing in vim. I used a makefile to check
spelling and check for simple grammatical rules. The process was much simpler
to manage. This motivated me to convert my blog to a static site. This post
describes my process on simplifying my writing process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Dr. Andrew Weil of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine states, “If we can make the correct diagnosis, the healing can begin. If we can’t, both our personal health and our economy are doomed. [1]” Accurate, traceable, and informed diagnosis are paramount to the health of patients. Medicine, within the United States, is an enormous $2.5 Trillion opportunity and with the proliferation of research over many decades new medical findings are being published than could ever be grokked, unassisted, by a doctor [2].</description>
