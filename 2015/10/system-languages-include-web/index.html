 today about some subtle C++ point and I came across
a comment that explicitly excludes the beginning language-learner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it confuses most novice C++ programmers that private virtuals
can be overridden&hellip; However the private virtual approach is now common
enough that confusion of novices is less of a concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This left me frustrated that a language that has been core to my personal
success so flippantly brushed aside its future user. The C++ community is
certainly undergoing a transformation. There is active effort to modernize,
and refresh C++.  However, lending a hand to beginners is not C++&rsquo;s forte.
There are more <a href="codereview.stackexchange.com">resources</a>
 to learn programming
today than when I started, however the struggles of a beginner are largely
unchanged. This comment left me thinking not that this C++ idiom is easier
to understand, its that there aren&rsquo;t any novices left in the C++ community.</p>
<p>I am currently reintroducing myself to D. There are two things that
I admire about the community. First, D is frank about the inconsistencies in
their language, and actively try to make it easier to understand. Second,
D embraces web application.</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://dconf.org/2015/index.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DConf videos</a>
 speakers voice pain points, and
inconsistencies in the language. The point isn&rsquo;t to complain, but to
acknowledge that language experts are not the only users.  With each point Walter
Bright (the language&rsquo;s author) carefully considers each point.</p>
<p>For example, one individual suggested that D&rsquo;s mixins are &ldquo;unprincipled&rdquo;.
Unprincipled meaning mixins are strings rather than expression trees as in C#&rsquo;s
LINQ, or Abstract Syntax Trees as in Rust&rsquo;s macros. Bright however
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s83u5iw67TY"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a>
 that he agrees mixins are unprincipled, but
&ldquo;&hellip;[that] they are easy to understand.&rdquo;  Making mixins as straightforward as string
manipulation makes an otherwise advanced technique something a novice can use.</p>
<p>I can certainly attest to the complexity of C#&rsquo;s LINQ. I&rsquo;ve
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->worked<!-- raw HTML omitted --> struggled on a LINQ provider for a in-house database
engine. LINQ Expression Trees are certainly in the upper echelons of advanced
techniques. Implementing mixins as string manipulation is a beautiful
concession to making a language easier to use.</p>
<p>The second principle I loved about the D community, and the thesis of
this post, is a single statement on <a href="http://wiki.dlang.org/Vision/2015H1"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D&rsquo;s roadmap</a>

&ldquo;Emphasize <a href="http://vibed.org/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vibe.d</a>
&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://vibed.org/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vibe.d</a>
 is an asynchronous I/O and web framework library for D.
I find the combination of I/O library and web framework similar to <a href="https://playframework.com/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play
Framework&rsquo;s</a>
 approach from Scala.  D is classified as a system
language. The same class as C++. However the D community considers (as does the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3n3b2d/trying_rust_for_web_services/cvl1lx1"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust
community</a>
, <a href="https://blog.wearewizards.io/trying-rust-for-web-services"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>
, <a href="http://arewewebyet.com/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>
) web
services a key enabler.</p>
<p>C++ is entrenched in enterprise applications.  However languages like D, and
Rust are among the few that can compete with C++&rsquo;s performance. This is,
I believe, C++&rsquo;s last life-preserving feature, entrenchment.  C++ is hard to
learn, hard to use, tends to define language experts (also see Haskell).  But
it is everywhere, and I can get a good paying job by knowing it.</p>
<p>HTTP/REST has established itself as the lingua-franca of Service Oriented
Architectures.  <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/play/play-framework-linkedin"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>
 maintains a beautiful and informative
blog about engineering a massively-online-multiplayer-role-playing-game, also
known as a social network. At it&rsquo;s heart are a number of services, written in
various languages, all linked together via HTTP. HTTP is the key that binds
them all. D is on-board with HTTP, and embracing the Web. Rust appears to be
as well. This is certainly a massive opportunity to compete with C++ at the
heart of its entrenchment, enterprise services.</p>
<p>As I work on my own personal projects, I like to use compiled languages. I have
quite a bit of experience with Django, but I don&rsquo;t feel confident to build
a large, long-term project in a duck-typed language. At risk of sounding like
a Haskeller, a strong type system really does help enforce a consistent
application. Even if one just considers refactoring, the compiler looks at
every line of code, and every function call, every time. I like to believe I&rsquo;m
professional enough an engineer to say my unit-test exercise 100% coverage,
but I know I&rsquo;ve never been successful in doing so. I would like to leverage my
expertise in C++ to build my personal web service experiments, but there
simply isn&rsquo;t a reasonable way to do that. Go is certainly a contender for this
space, but I prefer languages that give me more of a hand in generic
(parametric polymorphic) techniques. For me, now, that language is D.</p>
