                  <p>I wrote my first article for codestrokes in February 2011 - right as I was
accepted to graduate school. My goal was to improve my writing in preparation
for writing a thesis. While through grad school I started with more
traditional writing tool. I started to learn to write, and I found my writing
style: Simplicity.  I started writing with a big fancy word processor.
I blogged with a massive database backed blogging engine. By the time
I finished my thesis, I was writing in vim. I used a makefile to check
spelling and check for simple grammatical rules. The process was much simpler
to manage. This motivated me to convert my blog to a static site. This post
describes my process on simplifying my writing process.</p>

Currently, I'm on a testing kick. One might say tests are shiny. I don't
know if they are really shiny as much as I found another cool use for
uniform_int_distribution<>. A use which, as a side effect, might make me
appear to be a better software developer. (This assumes a negative bug rate is
proportional to better software). I've started playing with Property Testing.
Property Testing is a form of unit testing where the programmers defines
properties, or invariants about the code. A <del>framework</del> library (ok,
seriously its a framework because it calls your code) generates random
constrained inputs and calls your test functions. It's pretty cool, and while
I was playing around with the framework, I found a real bug, related to my
ignorance of C++'s auto type deduction.</p>

Our first assignment was to write a short paper describing a unit test, then implement selection sort and test it under that philosophy. Sarcastically, I commented to my colleagues the triviality of this question. The first response was, &ldquo;Wow, I don&rsquo;t think that is such an easy question.&rdquo; A technical discussion ensued.

                  A group of friends and I have been working on project euler for about a year now. I learned a great deal from this fantastic project, and it was the first time I was able to get a real handle on Haskell. Project Euler taught me make. It taught me better performance reporting techniques, honed my octave, and got me over that initial mind bending hump of Haskell. Thank you Project Euler, you will be missed.

                  I was discussing bootloader design with a colleague of mine the other day. We were attempting to load new a third-party hardware component. The device has a poor protocol, and a useless verification step. This discussion got me thinking however how the concepts used to build a strong self-enforcing security protocol, also apply to building a testable, and reliable communication protocol. Thus, security helps us build better products not because they are secure, but because they are verifiable.

                  <p>I worked the title of this article several times before I finally settled on the subtly epic heading you see above. Hopefully this title will funnel people off google into my blog (delicious SEO). I wanted to push the A.I. component of my solution because A.I. is awesome and mysterious, and cool (and can like solve jeopardy). I was quickly disillusioned however. Really, A.I. isn&rsquo;t magic, rather it&rsquo;s just the same thing computers have been doing for a long time: computing. Sadly this realization took several months in an A.I. class before I was sufficiently crestfallen. A.I. patterns including the hill climbing algorithm used here are indeed &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; but really it a reflecting of the algorithm designer, not the entity executing the algorithm. So I built a substitution cipher solver in C++. It&rsquo;s fast it uses random numbers i.e. non-deterministic, it uses an A.I. algorithm i.e. Intelligent, it uses threads i.e. Massively, it deciphers i.e. luminates the text and it solves super stuff therefore the title is completely justified. I give you my Massively Intelligent Non-Deterministic Luminating Effortless Super Solver (MINDLESS). If none of that interests you then please stick around and follow the side quest of looking for <a href="http://justenoughcraig.blogspot.com/2014/01/just-say-no-to-passive-aggressive.html">emotionally charged parenthesis</a>.</p>

                  A group of colleagues and I watched Sean Parent&rsquo;s Going Native Talk on &ldquo;C++ Seasoning&rdquo;. Parent takes some extreme views on how to use C++, but his examples for using the STL to simplify code are phenomenal. For a recent AI project I decided to apply Parent&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;no raw loops&rdquo;, I was blown away by the transformation&hellip; err std::transformation this had on my code. In this post I indented to demonstrate several complex code blocks, or overly specific code blocks what were replaced by some STL magic.
