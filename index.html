Namely, that specifications are not programming, and the math simplifies, by abstraction, the system.
 What exactly is being simplified by using math, instead of &ldquo;programming&rdquo;?
 During TLA⁺ study group this week, we discussed at least 1 aspect that applying math simplifies the description of our systems $$\rightarrow$$ The number of states.

This student is a very diligent worker and has been researching the problems trying to get a better understanding of the material before digging in. Sometimes however, there is no replacement for just digging in and coding something. This does at least two things, it solidifies the material you&rsquo;re read so far, and most importantly it shows you the limits of what you currently understand and urges you to learn more.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/quickcheck/">QuickCheck</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/im-stuck/">I&#39;m Stuck</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2020/05/learning-process/">

 By the way, it confuses most novice C++ programmers that private virtuals can be overridden&hellip; However the private virtual approach is now common enough that confusion of novices is less of a concern.
 This left me frustrated that a language that has been core to my personal success so flippantly brushed aside its future user.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/coding/">Coding</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2015/09/deploying-d-to-azure-webapp/">

            <p class="note title">Property Driven Design: MinMax</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 5, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote an article on Property Testing about a year ago. Isocpp.org even linked to it which was pretty cool. Recently, I uncovered a fantastic talk by Jessica Kerr about property testing . Kerr&rsquo;s talk reinvigorated my languid research effort toward generated testing. Kerr presented the idea (novel to me) that properties aren&rsquo;t rigid. Properties don&rsquo;t need to exclude all possible incorrect results for a given function. Properties simply must reduce the size of the incorrect space. This may seem like semantics, but it is easier to exclude a wild-ass-guess that verify it is correct. Additionally, some domains may not have a solidly defined answer,a nd the result my be probabilistic in nature. This post will focus on deterministic problems for the moment, but realize that property testing is vastly more general than mundane example testing. How properties reduce the size of the problem space makes me imagine this Figure.
Following Kerr&rsquo;s references, I found a set of projects from a predicate-logic course . This course provides 20 separate projects excellently cast for a property-driven-design tutorial. These projects are unique since besides the typical requirements they enumerate the predicate functions each requirement typifies. Predicate functions are to a predicate-logician as properties are to a computer scientist. These enumerated properties (predicates) clarified many points I misunderstood about property testing.
This post will step through the design of the first project minmax using C++. My primary goal for this article is to address a concern raised by a colleague, &ldquo;Does pulling in more complexity — a fancy test generator — actually increase quality?&rdquo;

            <p class="note title">Recasting how I blog</p><p class="note date">Sunday, June 7, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote my first article for codestrokes in February 2011 - right as I was accepted to graduate school. My goal was to improve my writing in preparation for writing a thesis. While through grad school I started with more traditional writing tool. I started to learn to write, and I found my writing style: Simplicity. I started writing with a big fancy word processor. I blogged with a massive database backed blogging engine. By the time I finished my thesis, I was writing in vim. I used a makefile to check spelling and check for simple grammatical rules. The process was much simpler to manage. This motivated me to convert my blog to a static site. This post describes my process on simplifying my writing process.
