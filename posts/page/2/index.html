            <p class="note title">Property Driven Design: MinMax</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 5, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote an article on Property Testing about a year ago. Isocpp.org even linked to it which was pretty cool. Recently, I uncovered a fantastic talk by Jessica Kerr about property testing . Kerr&rsquo;s talk reinvigorated my languid research effort toward generated testing. Kerr presented the idea (novel to me) that properties aren&rsquo;t rigid. Properties don&rsquo;t need to exclude all possible incorrect results for a given function. Properties simply must reduce the size of the incorrect space. This may seem like semantics, but it is easier to exclude a wild-ass-guess that verify it is correct. Additionally, some domains may not have a solidly defined answer,a nd the result my be probabilistic in nature. This post will focus on deterministic problems for the moment, but realize that property testing is vastly more general than mundane example testing. How properties reduce the size of the problem space makes me imagine this Figure.
Following Kerr&rsquo;s references, I found a set of projects from a predicate-logic course . This course provides 20 separate projects excellently cast for a property-driven-design tutorial. These projects are unique since besides the typical requirements they enumerate the predicate functions each requirement typifies. Predicate functions are to a predicate-logician as properties are to a computer scientist. These enumerated properties (predicates) clarified many points I misunderstood about property testing.
This post will step through the design of the first project minmax using C++. My primary goal for this article is to address a concern raised by a colleague, &ldquo;Does pulling in more complexity — a fancy test generator — actually increase quality?&rdquo;

            <p class="note title">Recasting how I blog</p><p class="note date">Sunday, June 7, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote my first article for codestrokes in February 2011 - right as I was accepted to graduate school. My goal was to improve my writing in preparation for writing a thesis. While through grad school I started with more traditional writing tool. I started to learn to write, and I found my writing style: Simplicity. I started writing with a big fancy word processor. I blogged with a massive database backed blogging engine. By the time I finished my thesis, I was writing in vim. I used a makefile to check spelling and check for simple grammatical rules. The process was much simpler to manage. This motivated me to convert my blog to a static site. This post describes my process on simplifying my writing process.

            <p class="note title">What is a Unit Test?</p><p class="note date">Thursday, August 28, 2014</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m taking a Software Testing and Verification course as part of my Master&rsquo;s work. Our first assignment was to write a short paper describing a unit test, then implement selection sort and test it under that philosophy. Sarcastically, I commented to my colleagues the triviality of this question. The first response was, &ldquo;Wow, I don&rsquo;t think that is such an easy question.&rdquo; A technical discussion ensued. This is that log.

I learned a great deal from this fantastic project, and it was the first time I was able to get a real handle on Haskell. Project Euler taught me make. It taught me better performance reporting techniques, honed my octave, and got me over that initial mind bending hump of Haskell. Thank you Project Euler, you will be missed.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/functional/">Functional</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2014/05/design-for-testability-via-security/">
            <p class="note title">Design for Testability via Security </p><p class="note date">Saturday, May 3, 2014</p><p class="note content">I was discussing bootloader design with a colleague of mine the other day. We were attempting to load new a third-party hardware component. The device has a poor protocol, and a useless verification step. This discussion got me thinking however how the concepts used to build a strong self-enforcing security protocol, also apply to building a testable, and reliable communication protocol. Thus, security helps us build better products not because they are secure, but because they are verifiable.

            <p class="note title">Massively Intelligent Non-Deterministic Luminating Effortless Super Solver</p><p class="note date">Wednesday, February 12, 2014</p><p class="note content">I worked the title of this article several times before I finally settled on the subtly epic heading you see above. Hopefully this title will funnel people off google into my blog (delicious SEO). I wanted to push the A.I. component of my solution because A.I. is awesome and mysterious, and cool (and can like solve jeopardy). I was quickly disillusioned however. Really, A.I. isn&rsquo;t magic, rather it&rsquo;s just the same thing computers have been doing for a long time: computing. Sadly this realization took several months in an A.I. class before I was sufficiently crestfallen. A.I. patterns including the hill climbing algorithm used here are indeed &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; but really it a reflecting of the algorithm designer, not the entity executing the algorithm. So I built a substitution cipher solver in C++. It&rsquo;s fast it uses random numbers i.e. non-deterministic, it uses an A.I. algorithm i.e. Intelligent, it uses threads i.e. Massively, it deciphers i.e. luminates the text and it solves super stuff therefore the title is completely justified. I give you my Massively Intelligent Non-Deterministic Luminating Effortless Super Solver (MINDLESS). If none of that interests you then please stick around and follow the side quest of looking for emotionally charged parenthesis.

            <p class="note title">Sean Parent: No Raw Loops</p><p class="note date">Sunday, November 24, 2013</p><p class="note content">A group of colleagues and I watched Sean Parent&rsquo;s Going Native Talk on &ldquo;C++ Seasoning &rdquo;. Parent takes some extreme views on how to use C++, but his examples for using the STL to simplify code are phenomenal. For a recent AI project I decided to apply Parent&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;no raw loops&rdquo;, I was blown away by the transformation&hellip; err std::transformation this had on my code. In this post I indented to demonstrate several complex code blocks, or overly specific code blocks what were replaced by some STL magic. Alexander Stepanov says, &ldquo;&hellip;code is a liability. &rdquo; The more code a program has the more likely it contains bugs. The fewer lines of code, the lesser the opportunity for a bug. I haven&rsquo;t quiet decided if I agree with this point, but it does induce thought either way. Sean Parent&rsquo;s methodology seems to agree, for the purposes of this post we&rsquo;ll agree as well.
