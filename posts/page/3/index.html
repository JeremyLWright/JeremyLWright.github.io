            <p class="note title">rand() Considered Harmful</p><p class="note date">Sunday, November 17, 2013</p><p class="note content">Stephan T Lavavej (STL) is a tactical speaker. In a short amount of time he convey&rsquo;s essential accurate information which is immediately applicable. In this talk at Going Native 2013, STL takes 20 minutes to teach us how to properly use random numbers in our programs: http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/rand-Considered-Harmful </p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/11/simplicity-does-matter/">
            <p class="note title">Simplicity Does Matter!</p><p class="note date">Tuesday, November 12, 2013</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m been sitting this draft for too long, but before I started my research experiment with Haskell I was looking for a language. I was approaching an AI class for my graduate work, and thought I&rsquo;d learn Lisp, or at least a lisp. Clojure  was hot, and new (read shiny), so I dove into learning about it&rsquo;s virtues. It&rsquo;s virtues are embodied in its creator, Rich Hickey, who while being a great programmer is a fantastic speaker.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/10/a-thunk-on-laziness/">
            <p class="note title">A Thunk on Laziness</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 27, 2013</p><p class="note content">I originally approached Haskell excited, and wide-eyed mystified by the type theory. Type became my golden hammer. In my C programs I typedef&rsquo;d everything so it&rsquo;d have a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; type. I was cautious with my casting. I was hooked. I had an intuitive understanding of laziness, as implemented by Haskell, that would allow one to write&quot;streaming&quot; algorithms. That is programs that deal with data in an online way to process data as it streams through. While that maybe true, you know what else can do that? C.

            <p class="note title">Idiomatic Learning</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 20, 2013</p><p class="note content">When learning a new language I find it helpful to study a languages idioms. Idioms exist in a language for a specific reason. Sometimes that reason is to further the principles of the language, other times it’s to mask, or otherwise deal with some underlying design decision of the language. Currently, I am studying Haskell, and currently I am struggle to clarify the idioms of the language. The syntax is still very new and awkward, currently with a total authoring in Haskell of 713 lines.

            <p class="note title">"Smaller" Reviews are More Effective</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 13, 2013</p><p class="note content">I was reviewing a new software module for work today, and discovered that when the class fit on a single screen my comments were more meaningful, than when the class was larger. My comments for spatially larger classes were mostly focused on syntactic, and idiomatic details. It was an interesting self-observation, but this certainly isn&rsquo;t new information.

            <p class="note title">The Itanium Flop</p><p class="note date">Monday, October 7, 2013</p><p class="note content">I wake up in the morning with ideas that please me, and some of those ideas actually please me also later in the day when I&rsquo;ve entered them into my computer. - Donald Knuth
I&rsquo;m on a bit of a Knuth kick right now, and I&rsquo;ve been procrastinating studying, and homework to find interviews, and papers by the master himself. I currently have a list of microfiche references to check out as soon as I get to the basement of my university&rsquo;s library: Woot, computational necromancy ! Through this, I came across a quote in an interview , &ldquo;&hellip;worse than the &ldquo;Itanium &rdquo; approach that was supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write.&rdquo; What? I thought it was simply market forces that drive the x86-64 ahead of Itanium: nope!

It had more of a system admin focus than security cracking exploits, but it was fun an nontheless a diverse learning experience for all those involved. However, almost immediately, I realized the number one rule in CTF, nothing is off limits!

            <p class="note title">My First Logic Program</p><p class="note date">Sunday, September 1, 2013</p><p class="note content">This semester, I&rsquo;m taking an introduction to artificial intelligence, and despite this being the second week, I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal. Our second assignment was to implement a program in clingo (clasp on gringo) which is a derivative of Prologue. This is my first experience with a logical programming language, and I am intrigued to the possibilities.

            <p class="note title">Artifical Intelligence Impact on Medicine</p><p class="note date">Wednesday, August 28, 2013</p><p class="note content">Dr. Andrew Weil of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine states, “If we can make the correct diagnosis, the healing can begin. If we can’t, both our personal health and our economy are doomed. [1]” Accurate, traceable, and informed diagnosis are paramount to the health of patients. Medicine, within the United States, is an enormous $2.5 Trillion opportunity and with the proliferation of research over many decades new medical findings are being published than could ever be grokked, unassisted, by a doctor [2]. Current advances in data mining have moved to alleviate the shear volume of information available to doctors. Medical data mining offers doctors the tools to distinguish anomalies from trending epidemics; the tools to make evidence based decisions, ultimately leading to more personalized medicine [2].
