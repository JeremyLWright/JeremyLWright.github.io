It had more of a system admin focus than security cracking exploits, but it was fun an nontheless a diverse learning experience for all those involved. However, almost immediately, I realized the number one rule in CTF, nothing is off limits!
The game was organized into two parts, a game server which collected the the scores and displayed the point totals of all teams in real-time, and the virtual servers (hosted on Amazon EC2) which contained the actual games.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/ctf/">CTF</a><a class="category" href="/categories/security/">Security</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/contest/">Contest</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/cracking/">cracking</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/ctf/">CTF</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hack-a-thon/">hack-a-thon</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hacking/">hacking</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/security/">Security</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/09/my-first-logic-program/">
            <p class="note title">My First Logic Program</p><p class="note date">Sunday, September 1, 2013</p><p class="note content">This semester, I&rsquo;m taking an introduction to artificial intelligence, and despite this being the second week, I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal. Our second assignment was to implement a program in clingo (clasp on gringo) which is a derivative of Prologue. This is my first experience with a logical programming language, and I am intrigued to the possibilities.
Immediately I was intrigued by the freeform expressiveness of the language. The example we did in class for example was to determine which muppet went to which amusement park.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/ai/">AI</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/08/artifical-intelligence-impact-on-medicine/">

If we can’t, both our personal health and our economy are doomed. [1]” Accurate, traceable, and informed diagnosis are paramount to the health of patients. Medicine, within the United States, is an enormous $2.5 Trillion opportunity and with the proliferation of research over many decades new medical findings are being published than could ever be grokked, unassisted, by a doctor [2].<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/writing/">Writing</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/08/interesting-article-about-monads/">

My intent has been to learn Haskell, and grasp the functional concepts. While working on several problems it&rsquo;s important to have a workflow that allows for a fast cycle time. I spent some time with Cabal, attempting to build a scheme that works efficiently, but was unable to do so. Instead I setup a mix of cabal-dev, and make to build a fast workflow that allow for compiling, testing, common code libraries, and benchmarks.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/functional/">Functional</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/automake/">automake</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/dependencies/">dependencies</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/dependency/">dependency</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/euler/">euler</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/generation/">generation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/haskell/">Haskell</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/make/">make</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/project-euler/">project euler</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/07/review-how-to-write-a-thesis-2/">
            <p class="note title">How to Write a Thesis</p><p class="note date">Wednesday, July 24, 2013</p><p class="note content">My family purchased this book for me, as a motivator to start thinking about the thesis component of my master&rsquo;s degree. &ldquo;It must be substantial&hellip;&rdquo; said a colleague of mine. &ldquo;It must be original work&hellip;&rdquo; Original, substantial, all words that left me with uneasiness about how to start. This book however was an easy read, and gave some very pragmatic advice on how to start, yet the most important quote I drew from the book was, &ldquo;What are the questions in your field?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/review/">Review</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/book/">book</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/07/is-monolithic-code-faster/">
            <p class="note title">Is Monolithic Code Faster?</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 14, 2013</p><p class="note content">As a software engineer I have a vested interest in disproving this statement. Bjarne Stroustroup says C++ is designed to create efficient abstractions. A software engineer’s job is to create simple abstractions to complex systems. State machines form a large part of many systems. The other day, a co-worker came to me, and asked, “Is it better to make straight line code for each case statement, even if it repeats, or is it better to abstraction into functions and make the code ‘cleaner’.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/compilation/">Compilation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/c&#43;&#43;/">C&#43;&#43;</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/optimization/">optimization</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/performance/">performance</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/07/patterns-are-evidence-of-a-languages-lacking/">

At first I struggled with this statement. How can you design a language general enough to be widely used, and simultaneously cover all the desirable idioms such that patterns are built in? At first this seemed silly to me, until I heard Erik Meijer state in a Haskell lecture, &ldquo;..this is why we implemented LINQ as a pattern instead of a language feature&hellip;&rdquo;<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/algorithm/">Algorithm</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/dsl/">DSL</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/pattern/">pattern</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/05/haskell-a-few-problems-later/">
            <p class="note title">Haskell a Few Problems Later</p><p class="note date">Tuesday, May 14, 2013</p><p class="note content">Well, the Haskell honeymoon is over for me. I spent some time working on a few Project Euler problems this weekend, and my initial assumptions formed from toy problems were dashed. While I was able to solve 3 problems fairly quickly, I faced a number of non trivial bugs, and memory issues. On the other side of my naïve passion, I’m finding a functional thought process, and it’s exciting.
My problems were really centered around a naïve belief that Haskell could convert my inefficient algorithms to some &ldquo;mathematically pure&rdquo; representation.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/haskell/">Haskell</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2013/04/haskell-day-1-again/">
