 My motivation for learning a topic. My misconceptions of a given topic and the seemingly magic qualities a beginner believes it can provide.  The learning questions are initially, almost certainly wrong. This is good. It shows my current understanding or lack there-of.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/learning/">learning</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/study/">study</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/reflection/">reflection</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2020/05/tla-chap1/">

That bias prevented me from seeing the point of the first chapter.
Hillel&rsquo;s first chapter ends with a definition of stuttering and how in the presence of real world temporal effects, a safe, reliable in all cases wire transfer system borders on impossible.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/design/">design</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/tla&#43;/">tla&#43;</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hillel/">hillel</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/book/">book</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2015/10/system-languages-include-web/">

 By the way, it confuses most novice C++ programmers that private virtuals can be overridden&hellip; However the private virtual approach is now common enough that confusion of novices is less of a concern.
 This left me frustrated that a language that has been core to my personal success so flippantly brushed aside its future user.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/opinion/">Opinion</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/d/">D</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/rust/">Rust</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/c&#43;&#43;/">C&#43;&#43;</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2015/09/deploying-d-to-azure-webapp/">

            <p class="note title">Property Driven Design: MinMax</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 5, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote an article on Property Testing about a year ago. Isocpp.org even linked to it which was pretty cool. Recently, I uncovered a fantastic talk by Jessica Kerr about property testing. Kerr&rsquo;s talk reinvigorated my languid research effort toward generated testing. Kerr presented the idea (novel to me) that properties aren&rsquo;t rigid. Properties don&rsquo;t need to exclude all possible incorrect results for a given function. Properties simply must reduce the size of the incorrect space. This may seem like semantics, but it is easier to exclude a wild-ass-guess that verify it is correct. Additionally, some domains may not have a solidly defined answer,a nd the result my be probabilistic in nature. This post will focus on deterministic problems for the moment, but realize that property testing is vastly more general than mundane example testing. How properties reduce the size of the problem space makes me imagine this Figure.
Following Kerr&rsquo;s references, I found a set of projects from a predicate-logic course. This course provides 20 separate projects excellently cast for a property-driven-design tutorial. These projects are unique since besides the typical requirements they enumerate the predicate functions each requirement typifies. Predicate functions are to a predicate-logician as properties are to a computer scientist. These enumerated properties (predicates) clarified many points I misunderstood about property testing.
This post will step through the design of the first project minmax using C++. My primary goal for this article is to address a concern raised by a colleague, &ldquo;Does pulling in more complexity — a fancy test generator — actually increase quality?&rdquo;

            <p class="note title">Recasting how I blog</p><p class="note date">Sunday, June 7, 2015</p><p class="note content">I wrote my first article for codestrokes in February 2011 - right as I was accepted to graduate school. My goal was to improve my writing in preparation for writing a thesis. While through grad school I started with more traditional writing tool. I started to learn to write, and I found my writing style: Simplicity. I started writing with a big fancy word processor. I blogged with a massive database backed blogging engine. By the time I finished my thesis, I was writing in vim. I used a makefile to check spelling and check for simple grammatical rules. The process was much simpler to manage. This motivated me to convert my blog to a static site. This post describes my process on simplifying my writing process.
