      <description>As a comparative study, I am porting a Red-Black Tree from C++ to the D programming language (Part 1, Part 2). Overall D is an easy, practical transition for the C++ programmer. D provides a number of features for implementing correct code, however it is D’s simplicity that makes it truly enticing as a replacement. While D retains _C Style Syntax, _it is considerably simpler than C++, especially in the presence of exceptions.</description>

      <description>This week, I started porting my C++ implementation of the Red-Black tree to D. I am trying to pay special attention to the features of D, intended to make writing correct code easier. While on that vane, I was reading an excellent article, discussing invariants, and I was pleased to find such a useful implementation of the class invariant in the D language.
Invariants come from the same “design-by-contract” idiom, famous for pre- and post- conditions.</description>

      <description>C++ Source Code D Source Code
D provides a number of features that simplify designing software, especially in the embedded environment. I will show in this 2 part comparison, between C++ and D, that D helps one write correct code. Correct code is something Andrei Alexandrescu, stresses heavily as a prominent feature of D. I use the Red-Black Tree for such a comparison since its complicated enough to make memory management difficult, while retaining real-world application.</description>
