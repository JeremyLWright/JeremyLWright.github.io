For me personally, abstraction was never clearly explained. I left school and entered my first job knowing I should abstract things, but I realize now my understanding of abstraction amounted to obscurity.

However the managed code renaissance is again in decline, and interestingly more than technology, business is changing the managed/native landscape. More than any other other metric, managed code is about maximizing programmer productivity.

Source code is the communication medium with the processor; Comment the medium to other coders, and UML the medium to higher-level communication. Computer Scientists have the stereotype of being poor communicators, but in our own mediums, we&rsquo;re phenomenal. This fact is no where more apparent, than trying to explain source code to someone else. How does one read source code? I&rsquo;m currently, learning Haskell, and my first goal is to understand this question.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2012/07/the-importance-of-system-design/">
            <p class="note title">The Importance of System Design</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 15, 2012</p><p class="note content">For the small programs we tend to implement as part of a semester project, or the simple &ldquo;one-off/get-it-done&rdquo; programs at work, system design rarely plays a part. However, even in the smallest problems a top-level system design is critical for consistency and ease of use. Class components, regardless of how precise and accurate they are in their own internal design, if they aren&rsquo;t externally consistent with other objects, the system will be brittle, and difficult to use.

            <p class="note title">Building an Interpreter</p><p class="note date">Monday, May 28, 2012</p><p class="note content">When I started programming, I thought that compilers where these magic behemoths; Oracles which consumed your source code, and prophesied the resulting program. I thought that the compiler was an integral part of the &ldquo;system&rdquo;. I was excited to realize that the compiler is simply another program. A program you can write yourself. You can write a compiler, for your very own language. Go ahead, make up a language, I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;
 Seriously though, making your own language is a very difficult task, and implementing a language useful enough for non-trivial problems is even more difficult. There is however, a very approachable goal here: Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). DSLs are focused languages useful to a limited group of people for a limited purpose.
I like to think of DSLs as tools. For example, sometimes one needs to automate a task, its might be easier to write a small program that helps with that task. But it might be even more useful to write a language that allows you to describe the problem better, then one can write a program using the new language to finish the task in an efficient and repeatable way. The program has limited usefulness beyond its initial application, but for the application at hand, its perfect. SQL is the canonical example. In this post we&rsquo;ll start with a basic grammar in EBNF. We&rsquo;ll translate that to a flex lexer, and connect that to a bison parser. We&rsquo;ll end up with a syntax tree which we&rsquo;ll execute to calculate a result.

            <p class="note title">Multicast Delegates in C++11</p><p class="note date">Sunday, March 25, 2012</p><p class="note content">C# has a wonderfully flexible delegate system capable of multicast events. This simple tool makes event driven software easier to write, and reduces coupling between objects. In 2003 Herb Sutter implemented a general form of the Observer pattern [1]. He called this the multi_function. It uses a mixture of TR1 and boost components to build a multi-cast delegate similar to C#&rsquo;s. Fast-forward 9 years, and we now have variadic-templates thanks to C++11. Variadic-Templates allow us to patch a missing component in Sutter&rsquo;s multi_function.

            <p class="note title">Abstract Syntax Trees: Introduction to Flex</p><p class="note date">Sunday, March 18, 2012</p><p class="note content">Bison is an incredibly powerful parser generator tool. However most of the examples, and tutorials demonstrate Bison&rsquo;s parsing ability, using on-the-fly computation instead of building a Syntax Tree. Bison is fully capable to generate the front-end of a simple compiler, but to do so, we have to build a syntax tree. Come to find out, building a syntax tree with Bison isn&rsquo;t that difficult, and the key is how one leverages the semantic actions. In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at a basic introduction to bison, then how to build a parse tree for a simple in-fix algebraic statement.

            <p class="note title">Branching with Mercurial</p><p class="note date">Monday, February 20, 2012</p><p class="note content">Mercurial supports two separate methods for branching. The first is built into how distributed version control functions, in that every clone is a branch itself. This is the branching method Joel Sposky recommends on hginit.com. The second method is called local branches . Initially I liked the local branch method; I liked it for the fact that I felt smart for using it. It did not improve productivity. There is a simple reason for this, with local branches it is difficult to diff the branch to the main branch of development e.g. the trunk. This post will walk through local branches, how I used then, and finally, how I quit local branches in favor of a cloning approach.

            <p class="note title">Compile-Time Polymorphism</p><p class="note date">Sunday, February 5, 2012</p><p class="note content">Polymorphism is a tool in object orientation, which allows us to model behavior, while simultaneously leverage existing code. Polymorphism allows is behavior reuse. In C++ polymorphism, comes in 2 flavors, the standard runtime variant, and a curious compile time variant. Runtime polymorphism, like Java, leverages virtual functions to dynamically bind[1. With virtual functions the compiler doesn&rsquo;t know which method to call until runtime. In C++ this is implemented with the virtual method table ] a method at the call site. Compile Time polymorphism uses templates, to bind at compile time, thus negating the performance affect of virtual functions.
