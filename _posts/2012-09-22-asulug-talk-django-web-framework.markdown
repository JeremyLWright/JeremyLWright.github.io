**The Django Web Framework**

**Jeremy Wright**



**Abstract**

Django: Awesome Jazz Musician, Awesome Web Framework.



Django is a web framework similar to the popular Ruby on RAILS, but leveraging the Python programming language. Born out of the newspaper industry, Django is touted as the “web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.” Django is a powerful tool for any size web project: Web Services, Storefronts, CMS’s—Django conquers all. Additionally, Django’s built-in webserver and automated back-end generator make for easy and fast development.



Please join the ASU Linux User’s Group on October 6th at 1:30pm to learn how to apply this amazing technology to your own projects.
