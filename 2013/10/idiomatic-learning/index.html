      <h1>Idiomatic Learning</h1>
<p>When learning a new language I find it helpful to study a languages idioms. Idioms exist in a language for a specific reason. Sometimes that reason is to further the principles of the language, other times it’s to mask, or otherwise deal with some underlying design decision of the language. Currently, I am studying Haskell, and currently I am struggle to clarify the idioms of the language. The syntax is still very new and awkward, currently with a total authoring in Haskell of 713 lines.</p>
<p>Python has some interesting idioms, but the one that really helped me when learning was “..tuples should have trailing commas…” At that time, the only other language I knew was C, and PIC Assembly. I was very much a hardware engineer, and Python, for me, was a step out of that hardware-centric mindset. So with such a staunch, inflexible background as this, such an idiom felt, dirty and wrong? My first reaction to this was, “What? Really? Why, are python programmers too lazy?” At first I refused to do this, claiming that my source code was more elegant, and clean. However some time later I learned the second part of this idiom, “…tuples should have trailing commas, BECAUSE syntactically the comma creates the tuple, not the parenthesizes.” Whoa! What an epiphany. From this simple clause, I can now create a tuple with 1 element! The because clause of an idiom, really opens doors in your mind. It really clarifies some subtle point, or characteristic of the language.</p>
<p>C++ on the other hand has a number of idioms that have become quite ingrained that it&rsquo;s hard to separate, &ldquo;yeah that&rsquo;s just C++ syntax&rdquo;, from, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how I do it,&rdquo; to, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I guess template <typename T> class &hellip; isn&rsquo;t very intuitive is it.&rdquo; C++ is a complex multi-paradigm language with one sweeping design decision: You pay for what you use. For instance, take class methods. In C++ class methods are not polymorphic by default. I remember as a fledgling C++ programmer asking my computer science friend, Brian, &ldquo;&hellip;classes are useless without polymorphism. That&rsquo;s just stupid.&rdquo; He tried to explain it to me, but I was probably to frustrated to understand. What I didn&rsquo;t know was the because, and I continued my ignorant use of virtual until I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201543303/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201543303&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=codestro-20">The Design and Evolution of C++</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=codestro-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0201543303" alt=""> that I learned the reason. Polymorphism requires a level of indirection to implement. Doing so affects performance. C++ doesn&rsquo;t push this on you unless you want it, just non-polymorphic by default, virtual if you want. Beautiful. Now as an embedded system designer I love this aspect of C++. I am free to use the features I need without paying for the ones I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So now as I approach Haskell, I read blogs, and statements with a temporary suspension of judgement until I learn the because.</p>
