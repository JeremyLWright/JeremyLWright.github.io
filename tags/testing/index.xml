      <description>Hitting the compile and run button costs $1,000,000. How would such a cost affect your test strategy? As extreme as that sounds, its a harsh reality for ASIC designers. The start-up costs for an ASIC design are extreme, as a result ASIC verification is very important. Especially since you can&amp;rsquo;t just update a buggy ASIC. In software engineering, we design increasingly complex systems requiring more and more elegant test strategies. I propose ASIC verification is in a more mature state, and software engineers could learn a lot from the translation of these techniques.</description>
