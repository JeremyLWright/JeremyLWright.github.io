      <description>For the last several months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Project Euler in Haskell. My intent has been to learn Haskell, and grasp the functional concepts. While working on several problems it&amp;rsquo;s important to have a workflow that allows for a fast cycle time. I spent some time with Cabal, attempting to build a scheme that works efficiently, but was unable to do so. Instead I setup a mix of cabal-dev, and make to build a fast workflow that allow for compiling, testing, common code libraries, and benchmarks.</description>
