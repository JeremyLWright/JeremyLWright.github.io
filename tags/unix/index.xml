      <description>I was reading a blog about coding interviews, and one comment made near the bottom struck me, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Um&amp;hellip; grep?&amp;rdquo; then they&amp;rsquo;re probably OK&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; As I read that comment, I realized I&amp;rsquo;d never answer that way, and I agreed with the author that was a problem. That began my dabble in grep, awk and sed, and these tools will change your workflow and even how you think about profiling code. Grep has even become a verb in my daily life, &amp;ldquo;Is this greppable?</description>
