      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say for a moment that you are a graduate student, with shell access to your schools server. The server maintains a number of tools you need for classes, and research.  All is well, except the stock editor on the server is wicked old.  Like an eternity old.  Well that happened to me. I am fully addicted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/jwright/vim-configuration&#34;&gt;my custom vim configuration&lt;/a&gt;, but it requires vim7.3.  My school&amp;rsquo;s server only has 7.0.  So, how does one install their own application with root privledges?  You create a private root.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Version Control More Than Collaboration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used version control in some form or another since I was a freshman in college, however I&amp;rsquo;m quite the anomaly.  I will use a tool fully knowing that its more than I need, just to learn something new.  Initially, this is how I approached version control. Except for a few unique situations version control of my homework, seemed like more work than it was worth.  I used to think version control was merely a collaboration tool for teams of people.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
