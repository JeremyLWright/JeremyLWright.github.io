      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used version control in some form or another since I was a freshman in college, however I&amp;rsquo;m quite the anomaly.  I will use a tool fully knowing that its more than I need, just to learn something new.  Initially, this is how I approached version control. Except for a few unique situations version control of my homework, seemed like more work than it was worth.  I used to think version control was merely a collaboration tool for teams of people.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
