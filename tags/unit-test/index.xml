Currently, I&#39;m on a testing kick. One might say tests are shiny. I don&#39;t
know if they are really shiny as much as I found another cool use for
uniform_int_distribution&lt;&gt;. A use which, as a side effect, might make me
appear to be a better software developer. (This assumes a negative bug rate is
proportional to better software). I&#39;ve started playing with Property Testing.
Property Testing is a form of unit testing where the programmers defines
properties, or invariants about the code. A &lt;del&gt;framework&lt;/del&gt; library (ok,
seriously its a framework because it calls your code) generates random
constrained inputs and calls your test functions. It&#39;s pretty cool, and while
I was playing around with the framework, I found a real bug, related to my
ignorance of C++&#39;s auto type deduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
