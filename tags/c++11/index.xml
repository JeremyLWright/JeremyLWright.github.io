      <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked the title of this article several times before I finally settled on the subtly epic heading you see above. Hopefully this title will funnel people off google into my blog (delicious SEO). I wanted to push the A.I. component of my solution because A.I. is awesome and mysterious, and cool (and can like solve jeopardy). I was quickly disillusioned however. Really, A.I. isn&amp;rsquo;t magic, rather it&amp;rsquo;s just the same thing computers have been doing for a long time: computing. Sadly this realization took several months in an A.I. class before I was sufficiently crestfallen. A.I. patterns including the hill climbing algorithm used here are indeed &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; but really it a reflecting of the algorithm designer, not the entity executing the algorithm. So I built a substitution cipher solver in C++. It&amp;rsquo;s fast it uses random numbers i.e. non-deterministic, it uses an A.I. algorithm i.e. Intelligent, it uses threads i.e. Massively, it deciphers i.e. luminates the text and it solves super stuff therefore the title is completely justified. I give you my Massively Intelligent Non-Deterministic Luminating Effortless Super Solver (MINDLESS). If none of that interests you then please stick around and follow the side quest of looking for &lt;a href=&#34;http://justenoughcraig.blogspot.com/2014/01/just-say-no-to-passive-aggressive.html&#34;&gt;emotionally charged parenthesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sean Parent: No Raw Loops</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of colleagues and I watched Sean Parent&amp;rsquo;s Going Native Talk on &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Cpp-Seasoning&#34;&gt;C++ Seasoning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Parent takes some extreme views on how to use C++, but his examples for using the STL to simplify code are phenomenal. For a recent AI project I decided to apply Parent&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;no raw loops&amp;rdquo;, I was blown away by the transformation&amp;hellip; err std::transformation this had on my code. In this post I indented to demonstrate several complex code blocks, or overly specific code blocks what were replaced by some STL magic. Alexander Stepanov says, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COuHLky7E2Q&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;code is a liability.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; The more code a program has the more likely it contains bugs. The fewer lines of code, the lesser the opportunity for a bug. I haven&amp;rsquo;t quiet decided if I agree with this point, but it does induce thought either way. Sean Parent&amp;rsquo;s methodology seems to agree, for the purposes of this post we&amp;rsquo;ll agree as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
