      <description>I was discussing bootloader design with a colleague of mine the other day. We were attempting to load new a third-party hardware component. The device has a poor protocol, and a useless verification step. This discussion got me thinking however how the concepts used to build a strong self-enforcing security protocol, also apply to building a testable, and reliable communication protocol. Thus, security helps us build better products not because they are secure, but because they are verifiable.</description>

      <description>This past weekend we held another capture the flag event at the Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group. It had more of a system admin focus than security cracking exploits, but it was fun an nontheless a diverse learning experience for all those involved. However, almost immediately, I realized the number one rule in CTF, nothing is off limits! The game was organized into two parts, a game server which collected the the scores and displayed the point totals of all teams in real-time, and the virtual servers (hosted on Amazon EC2) which contained the actual games.</description>
