      <title>Design for Testability via Security </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was discussing bootloader design with a colleague of mine the other day. We were attempting to load new a third-party hardware component. The device has a poor protocol, and a useless verification step. This discussion got me thinking however how the concepts used to build a strong self-enforcing security protocol, also apply to building a testable, and reliable communication protocol. Thus, security helps us build better products not because they are secure, but because they are verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Thunk on Laziness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally approached Haskell excited, and wide-eyed mystified by the type theory. Type became my golden hammer. In my C programs I typedef&amp;rsquo;d everything so it&amp;rsquo;d have a &amp;ldquo;unique&amp;rdquo; type. I was cautious with my casting. I was hooked. I had an intuitive understanding of laziness, as implemented by Haskell, that would allow one to write&amp;quot;streaming&amp;quot; algorithms. That is programs that deal with data in an online way to process data as it streams through. While that maybe true, you know what else can do that? C.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend we held another capture the flag event at the Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group. It had more of a system admin focus than security cracking exploits, but it was fun an nontheless a diverse learning experience for all those involved. However, almost immediately, I realized the number one rule in CTF, nothing is off limits!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
