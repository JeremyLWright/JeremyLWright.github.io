      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used version control in some form or another since I was a freshman in college, however I&amp;rsquo;m quite theÂ anomaly.

Except for a few unique situations version control of my homework, seemed like more work than it was worth. I used to think version control was merely a collaboration tool for teams of people.</description>
