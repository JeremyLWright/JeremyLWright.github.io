      <description>This past weekend we held another capture the flag event at the Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group. It had more of a system admin focus than security cracking exploits, but it was fun an nontheless a diverse learning experience for all those involved. However, almost immediately, I realized the number one rule in CTF, nothing is off limits!
The game was organized into two parts, a game server which collected the the scores and displayed the point totals of all teams in real-time, and the virtual servers (hosted on Amazon EC2) which contained the actual games.</description>

      <description>Black-Hat hacking in an controlled environment, like this, is an important skill for software developers. The Art of War describes knowing one&amp;rsquo;s enemy, and with the prevalence of internet-enabled applications today, it has never been more critical to know how the &amp;ldquo;enemy&amp;rdquo; can take down a system. While capture-the-flag is a fun, and exciting intellectual game, it is serious training for software engineers of all types, and skill levels. I recently setup a small capture the flag event for the Arizona Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group, and it was very fun.</description>
