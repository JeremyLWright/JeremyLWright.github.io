      <description>Productivity is an elusive mistress. I approach productivity much like any design problem. I lay out my requirements, and I iterate until I am happy with the outcome. Over the last few years I have spent a lot time laying out my design process. Along the way I found a number of tools that were helpful. This is my personal process and while I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great process. It&amp;rsquo;s important to refactor for yourself.</description>
