      <description>&lt;p&gt;Productivity is an elusive mistress.  I approach productivity much like any design problem. I lay out my requirements, and I iterate until I am happy with the outcome. Over the last few years I have spent a lot time laying out my design process.  Along the way I found a number of tools that were helpful.  This is my personal process and while I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great process.  It&amp;rsquo;s important to refactor for yourself. The key to my productivity is consistency. I work well with a defined workflow. Lastly, interruptions are a certainty, so one must find a way to make context switches less disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Try to setup natural stopping points in your process. You will be interrupted so make context switches cheap.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my process, and tools help me deal with strict and dynamic constraints.  I use a number of tools help me be productive, yet consistency is the most powerful function for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
