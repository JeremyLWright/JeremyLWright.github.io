      <description>Parallelism, it sounds like a religion, and in some sense it is. Like many facets of software engineering, writing good parallel code is more of an art than a science. I come from a FPGA background where parallelism is part of the language; part of the culture! The tools are designed to find deadlocks, analyze timing and the language itself is fully aware of parallelism. The hardware world understands parallelism, yet writing parallel software is still difficult.</description>
