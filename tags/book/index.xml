      <description>American Sign Language has this beautiful word roughly translated to blur or smear. It means to blur details of a situation in order to see some greater value.

This book however was an easy read, and gave some very pragmatic advice on how to start, yet the most important quote I drew from the book was, &amp;ldquo;What are the questions in your field?</description>
