    <h1 class="article title">My TLA+ Saga</h1><p class="article date">Wednesday, September 8, 2021</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><ul>
<li>Learning together is more fun, and you may not be as self-taught as you believe.</li>
<li>The stories we tell ourselves deeply impact our ability (or inability) to grow.</li>
<li>The more you learn, the more challenging the material becomes to continue growing. (a.k.a. Duh, but it took me time to realize it, regardless)</li>
</ul>
<p>This year mark&rsquo;s my 3rd attempt to learn TLA+.</p>
<p>The first time was likely around the same time <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillel Wayne</a>
 also discovered it. Although where Hillel (obviously) <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/tackling-concurrency-tlaplus/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grokked it the first time</a>
, when I discovered that TLA+ is not a tool for auto-generating property based tests, I quit.</p>
<p>The second time, I attended the <a href="https://conf.tlapl.us/2019/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLA+ conference in 2019</a>
. I was better prepared to understand the purpose of a spec. This is, in part, because I was aware of the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of the day-job&rsquo;s work. Where I had work in aviation, and and embedded systems for awhile, I was compartmentalized. Understandably so as I earned more experience, however I was unprepared to understand large scale the purpose of a specification. 2019 I was just starting to see the value. However, I had a second personal hurdle: I was &ldquo;self taught&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Being &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; was a point of pride for me. I encapsulated my value to an team by my ability to understand new ideas and be effective reasonably quickly. So much so, that I realized I would hamper myself my not asking for help so I could carry the badge of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m self taught&rdquo;. Guess what, no one cares. If you learn something with a group, from a teacher, or on your own&hellip; NO ONE CARES.</p>
<p>Also, it was at least partially a lie. Up to this point, I told myself: &ldquo;taught myself C++&rdquo;. Ya, no. I was surrounded by colleagues who knew a plethora of languages: Python, Go, D, C. Yes, I would self-study, but being surrounded by those who can provide a contrast for your own understanding of a material <em>is invaluable</em>!</p>
<p>This third time, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tlaplus/comments/lvloul/study_partner/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to reddit</a>
: Who&rsquo;s coming with me!??!!? It&rsquo;s going better. Stay tuned for a series on my todo spec.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you to all those in my life who helped me learn the things I know. I am self-motivated, but my knowledge is because of the people in my life.</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class="tag" href=/tags/reflection/>reflection</a></section><div class="article share addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></div><script defer src="/js/addthis_widget.min.99872df1091f055fca553e0b74b13c09bd383ef42b1c56a9edb651a91f122d56e7bc9a2fad73528246215b379b043226.js#pubid=ra-1234567890" integrity="sha384-mYct8QkfBV/KVT4LdLE8Cb04PvQrHFap7bZRqR8SLVbnvJovrXNSgkYhWzebBDIm"></script>
