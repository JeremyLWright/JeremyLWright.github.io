      <h1>My TLA+ Saga</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learning together is more fun, and you may not be as self-taught as you believe.</li>
<li>The stories we tell ourselves deeply impact our ability (or inability) to grow.</li>
<li>The more you learn, the more challenging the material becomes to continue growing. (a.k.a. Duh, but it took me time to realize it, regardless)</li>
</ul>
<p>This year mark&rsquo;s my 3rd attempt to learn TLA+.</p>
<p>The first time was likely around the same time <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/">Hillel Wayne</a> also discovered it. Although where Hillel (obviously) <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/tackling-concurrency-tlaplus/">grokked it the first time</a>, when I discovered that TLA+ is not a tool for auto-generating property based tests, I quit.</p>
<p>The second time, I attended the <a href="https://conf.tlapl.us/2019/">TLA+ conference in 2019</a>. I was better prepared to understand the purpose of a spec. This is, in part, because I was aware of the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of the day-job&rsquo;s work. Where I had work in aviation, and and embedded systems for awhile, I was compartmentalized. Understandably so as I earned more experience, however I was unprepared to understand large scale the purpose of a specification. 2019 I was just starting to see the value. However, I had a second personal hurdle: I was &ldquo;self taught&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Being &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; was a point of pride for me. I encapsulated my value to an team by my ability to understand new ideas and be effective reasonably quickly. So much so, that I realized I would hamper myself my not asking for help so I could carry the badge of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m self taught&rdquo;. Guess what, no one cares. If you learn something with a group, from a teacher, or on your own&hellip; NO ONE CARES.</p>
<p>Also, it was at least partially a lie. Up to this point, I told myself: &ldquo;taught myself C++&rdquo;. Ya, no. I was surrounded by colleagues who knew a plethora of languages: Python, Go, D, C. Yes, I would self-study, but being surrounded by those who can provide a contrast for your own understanding of a material <em>is invaluable</em>!</p>
<p>This third time, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tlaplus/comments/lvloul/study_partner/">posted to reddit</a>: Who&rsquo;s coming with me!??!!? It&rsquo;s going better. Stay tuned for a series on my todo spec.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you to all those in my life who helped me learn the things I know. I am self-motivated, but my knowledge is because of the people in my life.</p>
