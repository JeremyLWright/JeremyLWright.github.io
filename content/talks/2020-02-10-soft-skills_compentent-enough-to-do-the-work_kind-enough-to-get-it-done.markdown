What is your super power? Are you a l33t coder? Whip up a website? Burn a time
checked FPGA? Actually get CSS to roll up the window? 

I am Jeremy Wright. I have been lucky enough to complete a master's degree of
information assurance by the grace of many. I have been blessed enough to
complete a bachelor's of electrical engineering. I have deep experience in
FPGAs, DSP microcontrollers, firmware, software, websites. You know my super
power? 

Listening. 

I am a sign-language interpreter. My wife is deaf and we use sign language as
the primary means of communication. Now that my hands are moving, its highly
unlikely they will stop. We'll see. Watch for some fun signs... It's the
mini-game to this talk.

In American Sign Language is a fascinating visual-spacial language. Its visual, its
structural. Where you sign "establish" something matters. However, American
Sign Language has a novel solution to a very interesting pitfall. ASL has
a limited number of signs but allows for custom vocabulary for specialized
domains...

Hmmm... That's interesting... Where else do we have specialized domains and
the need for a customized vocabulary? Left as an exercise to the reader.

When an interpreter meets a deaf person for the first time to say interpret
vector calculus. The interpreter will typically ask the individual, "What are
you custom words for this domain?" 

Integral -> *sign*
Derivative -> *sign*
Limit -> *sign*
Laplace Transform -> *sign*
Algorithm -> *sign*
yadda... yadda... yadda...

The interpreter is now expected to listen to the professor and map the
professor's teaching that day into the student's custom vocabulary! Seriously.
This is a thing. Please, can I get a round of applause for all the ASL
interpreters in the world today?

**The Martian: (Scene where the geeks reference lord of the rings and the PM
doesn't get it)**
Let's recast this into a little bit more familiar situation. Sprint planning.
On one side you have product team, and the project manager. These are smart
people! On the other side you have us. Those with a highly specialized
vocabulary for the work we do. We need an interpreter. 


Interpreters have a second super power: Body Language. American Sign Language
has no tenses. When you speak you do so with a flowing tone. Hopefully I do
too, or y'all fall asleep. When a person is mute, how can they provide
inflection? Body Language. A common question I get is, "When your wife is mad
at you how does she yell?" 

She signs incredibly fast. It's best to just sit there and listen... when the
blur slows down follow with, "yes, dearest, sweetheart... do you mind signing
it again?"

Interpreters have a third super power: They look at you. This doesn't seem
like a super power, but it will transform your relationships. Not just your
professional ones, but your personal ones as well.  When I was first married,
I thought one of the most frustrating part was that I cannot just listen to my
wife. I have to LOOK at her when she is speaking. This also means we cannot
talk in the car. Cuz danger. But it also means I can pick what's on the radio.
Bonus! This is is actually an amazing tool, try it. For the next week,
everytime your significant other speaks to you, every time. Put down whatever
you are doing. set down everything in your hands, so you can respond if
necessary. Then listen. Don't kinda listen and prepare what you want to say.
Listen. If you need a moment to consider your response just said, "let me
think about that."

Now you have your 3 super powers, you recognize everyone has a custom
vocabulary, listen for it. You recognize people have body language, listen for
it. You look at people when they speak -> that's just listening.

I want to leave you with one more tool. The paper cache. Get yourself
a notebook. Get yourself a pen. You can get an inexpensive Pilot G2 0.38mm, or
a sweet Lamy with classic ink (be a snob about your pen. Its a great
conversation starter.... I collect ink. Oh um where? Um, what? In my pen. Oh
um what?)

Pull out your notebook, when someone is speaking you are doing what? You are
listening. You are not interrupting (even though you are probably thinking
faster than them because you aren't speaking). Remember your brain isn't
working on speaking at the moment, hence you are thinking faster than they
are. Write down trigger words, hints, draw a picture, anything that will help
you cache the conversation. I think of it as a pointer to the idea. So you can
pull it from glacier storage.  When the person finishes speaking say, "Wow,
that's interesting. I have a few comments, points, whatever." 

The paper cache has another benefit, when others don't have a cache, they will
interrupt you. Let them get it out. Cache your comments, then pick up where
you left off. 

This may sound pretentious, but it is an incredible tool. Do not take notes on
your phone. You will be distracted. When you listen to people, they will tell
you more. And when you are surrounded but the most important people in your
life, and some of the most intelligent people in the world don't you want to
truely hear what they have to say?


Meeting Chris -> started my career
- Introduce yourself to people but introducing them to others.
- Never be afraid of the rephrase (Especially in an international settings,
  which is always)
- Did I answer your question?
- Are you a 10x coder? You know who is a 100x coder? The person who can steer 10
  10x coders. 
Learning Sign Language -> Met a local business owner -> Learned
microcontrollers -> first engineering job

People are what build your career. You wanna be great? You want to accomplish
something awesome? Listen. This room if filled with some of the top technical
talent in our industry. This room is filled with some of the most intelligent
people one can ever meet. Learn from them.
