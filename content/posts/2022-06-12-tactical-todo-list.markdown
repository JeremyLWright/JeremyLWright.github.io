[Bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) (Bujo) is an incredible organization tool. If you haven't tried it, check out the original (non-art) form. It's terse, concise, and for my and a lot of people, unreasonably effective. After several years of bullet journals however I was left with a stack of journals, full of **unsurfacable interestingness**. Many ideas are bound in the pages, but are locked there among many pages of chaff. The signal to noise ratio of the pages is quite low, so it's not a reasonable use of my time to go through and pull out the ideas. However, the thing the bullet journal does provide is a habit of getting tactical ideas to paper immediately. Once on paper,  I'm free to forget about the task until it's executive mode time and I need to crank through my tasks in a focused manner. 

# How I setup my todo list

Inspired by Bujo's weekly spreads I use a weekly layout that minimizes the overhead rewriting daily tasks, as well as captures how long a task has sat on my list. I follow Plant Based Bride's Weekly layouts

# When the muse comes, welcome them

The todo list helps me achieve presence. When I am distracted by those "Oh I gotta do it..." I don't stop. I add it to my weekly todo, and continue. 

Conversely, when I am in "executive mode", 

1. I scan my todo list
2. Identify the forcing items that need to be done 
3. Do the item. (or at least make progress on it. I called this "bring the item forward")
4. cross them off 
5. Repeat until my executor is exhausted, or until I have a "day dream distraction".  

I always allow a creativity distraction redirect my attention. When *the muse* comes, welcome them. Creativity mode is higher priority than executor mode. Creativity (On intelligence calls daydream mode) trumps executor.
