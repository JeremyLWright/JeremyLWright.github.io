## Learning Questions

My learning process consists of a set of learning questions. These questions
are almost certainly wrong and reflect at least the following:

1. My motivation for learning a topic.
1. My misconceptions of a given topic and the seemingly magic qualities
   a beginner believes it can provide.

The learning questions are initially, almost certainly wrong. This is good. It
shows my current understanding or lack there-of. Refinement of these questions
over time will lead to a deeper understanding of the material.

## Anki Cards

I'm currently following the precepts of incremental reading, and capturing of
facts and ideas into Anki cards. These cards serve as a foundation for
understanding. Facts themselves cannot build intuition but they provide
anchors for a framework of understanding.
