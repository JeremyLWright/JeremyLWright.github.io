I'm been sitting this draft for too long, but before I started my research experiment with Haskell I was looking for a language. I was approaching an AI class for my graduate work, and thought I'd learn Lisp, or at least _a_ lisp.  [Clojure ](http://clojure.org/)was hot, and new (read shiny), so I dove into learning about it's virtues. It's virtues are embodied in its creator, Rich Hickey, who while being a great programmer is a fantastic speaker. The first talk I watched from him, "[Are We There Yet?](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey)" which is a deep philosophical approach to parallelism.  I in 2012, Rich Hickey was invited to speak at RubyCon, and he gave a fantastic talk titles, "[Simplicity Matters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)". Absolutely fantastic! Eventually, I made my way into Haskell, largely by a comment from Andrei Alexandresku, "[Haskell, the language everyone wishes they know.](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C-and-Beyond-2012-Andrei-Alexandrescu-Systematic-Error-Handling-in-C)" Rich Hickey's words however remain in each line of code I write, Do not complect, simplicity matters.
