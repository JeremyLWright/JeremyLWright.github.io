I am releasing under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US).Â my django game server for running Capture the Flag events.

This server does have some known bugs which I enumerated in the issue tracker. I developed this first version for the Fall 2012 ASULUG hacking competition. I hope people can get involved and make this a fantastic game server! Please feel free to contact me, or simply fork the repository. I look forward to seeing everyone's interesting pull requests! Thank you.
