A group of friends and I have been working on project euler for about a year now. I learned a great deal from this fantastic project, and it was the first time I was able to get a real handle on Haskell. Project Euler taught me make. It taught me better performance reporting techniques, honed my octave, and got me over that initial mind bending hump of Haskell. Thank you Project Euler, you will be missed.
