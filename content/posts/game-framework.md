For this year's C++ practicum, we are going to build a small game engine.Â  I'm keeping the code on bitbucket: <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jwright/gamecomponents">http://bitbucket.org/jwright/gamecomponents</a> Join us, or fork the code and make your own design. I look forward to seeing how this progresses.
