My family purchased this book for me, as a motivator to start thinking about the thesis component of my master's degree. "It must be substantial..." said a colleague of mine. "It must be original work..." Original, substantial, all words that left me with uneasiness about how to start. This book however was an easy read, and gave some very pragmatic advice on how to start, yet the most important quote I drew from the book was, "What are the questions in your field?" Oh, that's a much easier way to look at it. Not as, "I must make something original." Rather, "I have to answer some questions..."  This book really triggered a thought in my own thesis planning. and I recommend taking a look.
