I really like all the little social media button on blogs. I hit the +1 and I feel like I contribute in some way.  When I post here to my personal blog, wordpress automatically posts to my Facebook. Its entirely unoriginal, but I like it. However I think we need a -1 button for some articles.  I read this: [http://mashable.com/2011/06/22/arizona-social-media-day/](http://mashable.com/2011/06/22/arizona-social-media-day/) and thought to myself, "Wow, that's dumb. I am embarrassed for my state."  I wanted to hit a -1 button. I want to publicly declare my negative opinion.  Oh well, such a widget is probably outside of Google's "Do no Evil" mantra.  It'd be cool anyway.
