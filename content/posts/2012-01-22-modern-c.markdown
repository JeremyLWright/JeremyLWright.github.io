I found an awesome talk on how the new changes of C++11 are modernizing, an already fantastically powerful language. [http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-835T](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-835T).

In this talk, Herb Sutter does two things I feel are quite admirable. Firstly, despite this being a Microsoft conference, he talks only about standard, portable C++ until the final minutes.

Secondly, he very clearly, compares idioms we currently use, to the new C++11 idioms. This made it very easy for me to see the value of what C++11 provides. If you want to start using C++11 in your own projects checkout this talk!
