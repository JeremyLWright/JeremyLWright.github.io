This server does have some known bugs which I enumerated in the issue tracker. I developed this first version for the Fall 2012 ASULUG hacking competition. I hope people can get involved and make this a fantastic game server! Please feel free to contact me, or simply fork the repository. I look forward to seeing everyone's interesting pull requests! Thank you.
