For this year's C++ practicum, we are going to build a small game engine.Â  I'm keeping the code on bitbucket: [http://bitbucket.org/jwright/gamecomponents](http://bitbucket.org/jwright/gamecomponents) Join us, or fork the code and make your own design. I look forward to seeing how this progresses.
