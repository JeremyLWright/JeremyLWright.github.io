My name is Jeremy Wright.

I love software, and the impact we make on the individuals in our world. My
perspective on quality is ever evolving and this blog is intended as
breadcrumbs describing that change.

If you would like to know more about my opinions try some of my articles, Iâ€™d
love to hear your comments and discussions.
