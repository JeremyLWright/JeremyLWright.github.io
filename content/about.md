I specialize in the software no one sees. The high performance, concurrent,
hard real-time, high-reliability systems that enable our way of life. 

My software fights fraud, and drives tractors. I've baked solar cells, made
escalators more efficient, optimized fantasy sports. My software helps
airplanes land safely.

I've improved data center efficiency, and contributed designs and
implementation of risk-management microservices for high-performance payment
systems behind [Zelle&#174;](https://ZellePay.com). Currently, I am working to
integrated messaging at [JoyLabs](https://joylabs.com) and [Memo](https://memo.com/)

Through all my digital adventures I've never forgot what it is to be
a beginner. I love to share that curiosity, and freshness with others in my
classes.
