When you do things right, no one can be sure you did anything at all (Futurama Season 3) 

I specialize in the software no one sees. The high performance, concurrent,
real-time, high-reliability systems that enable our way of life.  I love the
software no one notices. 

My software fights fraud, and drives tractors. I've baked solar cells, made
escalators more efficient, optimized fantasy sports and my software helps
airplanes land safely.

I've improved data center efficiency, and currently design and maintain
risk-management microservices for high-performance payment systems behind
Zelle. Currently, I am working on a novel approach to integrated messaging at
